Darjeeling is a town in India's West Bengal state, in the Himalayan foothills. Once a summer resort for the British Raj elite, it remains the terminus of the narrow-gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, or "Toy Train", completed in 1881. It's famed for the distinctive black tea grown on plantations that dot its surrounding slopes. Its backdrop is Mt. Kanchenjunga, among the world’s highest peaks. Darjeeling is almost covers with green natural vegetation like pine, sal, teak, oak etc. The flaming red rhododendrons, the sparkling white magnolias are found in Himalaya Darjeeling. A perfect blend of nature and harmony, Darjeeling is undoubtedly a place to be at. The sprawling tea estates and the rolling lofty mountains dotted with red roof houses exemplify the beauty of Darjeeling.</h3></p>
