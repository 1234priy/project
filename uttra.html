<h1><u>Adventure in Uttarakhand</u></h1>

<p><h3>Calling Out’ to the adventure aficionados are the mountains, rivers, unbeaten paths, the sprawling alpine meadows and the snow-clad gradients in the gorgeous state of Uttarakhand. The rugged topography and the raging glacial rivers convert the state into the finest adventure destination in India. Further enhancing the charm of the challenges in Uttarakhand is the unpredictable climate that locks horns with the adventurists only to make the experience even more memorable. Undoubtedly, the state is an ideal adventure tourism destination in India as it beckons some adventure activities that offer spine-chilling and distinct experiences rarely found anywhere else. 
The state is the home to some of the interesting and picturesque treks in India. The enigmatic trekking trails that mostly are flower-strewn offer unprecedented surreal views and further enhance the charm of choosing an adventure activity here. The state gives complete liberty to pick the trek of one's choice as there are all kinds of treks (Easy, Moderate, Difficult and Tough) available. Each category of treks has its challenges and rewards. There are some treks that require mountain climbing and rope walking, and there are treks that offer a majestic view of peaks like Nanda Devi and Trishul and also a chance to visit some of the best places in Uttarakhand. Many of the treks proffer the opportunity to have a glance at the rural lifestyle and interact with the locals, whereas a few treks render a chance to camp under the starry sky in solitude. 
Also, there are treks that lead to earthly abodes of gods like Kedarnath and Badrinath, and then there are trails that open into an earthly paradise like Valley of Flowers.
The glacial-fed rivers in Uttarakhand are ideal for pursuing the finest white water rafting adventures in India. River Ganga, which is also reckoned to be the holiest river in the country, can be seen in a dual role in Rishikesh. Where, on one hand, the river is the soul cleanser of the believers who take a dip of faith in it; on one hand, it is a wild and whimsical river that is capable of offering a spine-chilling experience while rafting. Tons River, which is the main tributary of River Yamuna, is equivalent of Ganga at Rishikesh. It takes courage and heart to raft over its water that is accompanied with Grade IV rapids. A seasonal rafting expedition can also be attained at River Kosi that flows along the suburb of Corbett National Park.
The state's well-laid and snow-clad slopes are proud as a peacock to be one of the best skiing destinations in India. Auli, which is situated a short distance from Joshimath, invites skiers from across the world to enjoy fine powder skiing on its slopes. Apart from this, the topography of Uttarakhand allows several other adventure sports like paragliding and mountain biking that may gradually pick up the pace in the time to come.
