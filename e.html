<p><h3>Sikkim is the smallest Northeastern state of India, flanked by Bhutan, Nepal, Tibet and West Bengal on its four sides. Home to the Himalayan mountain range, Mt Kangchenjunga, the highest mountain peak of India, is located in Sikkim. Gangtok is the capital city of Sikkim.
Sikkim became a part of India as late as 1975. An independent monarchy before, little is known about its history, apart from it being a base for Tibetans, and the British building the hamlet of Gangtok as their military base when forging into Tibet during the 19th century.
The impact of this is still vibrant today in the culture, look and feel of the city. It is dotted with Tibetan monasteries and Tibetan culture. Resembling the Bhutanese capital, Thimpu, in its structure, it is a small hill city, a perfect place to unwind and connect with nature. A popular base for treks, Gangtok attracts trekkers from all over India and abroad. Unlike big cities, Gangtok has none of the noise, pollution and bustle, nor a skyline of tall buildings, but is equipped with plentiful amenities to give its visitors are wholesome experience of life in the mountains.</h3></p>
