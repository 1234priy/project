<p><h3>The valleys of Jammu and Kashmir include the Kashmir Valley, Chenab Valley, Sindh Valley, and Lidder Valley. Srinagar, with its renowned Dal Lake and Mughal Gardens, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Bhaderwah, Patnitop, and Jammu are all popular tourist destinations in Jammu and Kashmir. Thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit the sacred temples of Vaishno Devi and Amarnath each year, which has a substantial impact on the state's economy. 
Kashmir Valley is one of India's most popular tourist destinations. Gulmarg, one of India's most famous ski resort locations, also has the world's highest green golf course. Tourism has fallen during the last three decades. 
There are also flower gardens and apple orchards in Jammu and Kashmir. Tourists come here for the handicrafts and Kashmiri shawls.</h3><p>
