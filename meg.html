<p><h3>Meghalaya has predominantly an agrarian economy with a significant commercial forestry industry. The important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, and spices. The service sector is made up of real estate and insurance companies. Meghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at ?16,173 crore in current prices. The state is geologically rich in minerals, but it has no significant industries. The state has about 1,170 km of national highways. It is also a major logistical center for trade with Bangladesh. 
In July 2018, the International Commission on Stratigraphy divided the Holocene epoch into three,with the late Holocene being called the Meghalayan stage/age,since a speleothem in Mawmluh cave indicating a dramatic worldwide climate event around 2250 BCE had been chosen as the boundary stratotype.
One of the biggest Central Institutes, the North Eastern Council Secretariat, is also situated in Shillong.</h3></p>
